# Example for the _Analysis_TEMPLATE.m_ Matlab script

This directory contains the Matlab script _Analysis_TEMPLATE.m_ which can be used to simplify the data post processing for any number of files.

**This directory should not be added to the Matlab path!**

## Contens

* _Analysis_TEMPLATE.m_ -> the main script as template for you copy and extend
* _my_knownDataSets.m_ -> a function which returns the configuration of N data sets
* _functions/_ -> folder for custom functions you want to use in your scripts
* _../tmt_getDataFromFile.m_ -> function which does the actual work; feel free to use it anywhere
