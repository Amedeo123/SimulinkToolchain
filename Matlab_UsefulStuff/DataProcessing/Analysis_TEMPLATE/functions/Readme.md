# Custom functions for the _Analysis_TEMPLATE.m_ Matlab script

This directory contains some custom functions needed by _Analysis_TEMPLATE.m_ Matlab script or your version of this file.

**This directory should not be added to the Matlab path!**

**The Symlink to _tmt_getDataFromFile_ should be removed in your version, because _Matlab_UsefulStuff/DataProcessing/_ should be in the Matlab path.**
However, having the symlink allows for easy testing the template.
